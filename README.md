# Prediction of the normalized price of a used device
## Programming's project

In the digital age we live in, mobile phones have become an essential tool. The rapid and constant technological advancements have led to the continuous introduction in
the market of new devices, such as smartphones, tablets, smartwhatches, smart tvs and other. As a result, the used industry\
has become increasingly relevant, offering a more affordable option for those looking to own a quality device at a lower price.

Choosing a price for a used device may be a complex task, that\'s why for my programming project I decided to prepare a statistical analysis on predicting
the normalized price of a used device. To estimate the normalized price of a used phone. To achieve this, I decided to create a linear regression model for which I chose the
most influent variables through forward selection. The statistical analysis will be based on a dataset made of 3454 samples (devices) and 15
variables that includes detailed information about used phones, such as technical specifications and design features.'''
